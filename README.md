# extended-noteblocks
Hybrid Resource Pack for Bedrock and Java Edition which changes the sample sounds of note blocks in the game

YouTube Demo: https://youtu.be/CTVWzjL69UU

To Install for Bedrock Edition, simply double click the `extended-noteblocks.mcpack` file after it's installed. \
The Install for Java Edition is a bit more complicated:
```
Path for Java Edition: %AppData%\Roaming\.minecraft\resourcepacks\extended-noteblocks.zip
Path for Bedrock Edition: %LocalAppData%\Packages\Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalState\games\com.mojang\resource_packs
```
A `.mcpack` file is just a renamed .zip file that Minecraft Bedrock recognises. \
`sounds.json` is `\u00A7b\u00A7lBased on Realistic Noteblocks\u00A7r by\u00A7e Gelly!` \
and the Vanilla Resource Pack authors as this is how it started instead of from scratch. \
Most of the `.ogg` sound files have been replaced with newly generated ones.
